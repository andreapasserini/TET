# Type Extension Trees

Type Extension Trees (TET) are a powerful representation language for
"count-of-count" features characterizing the combinatorial structure
of neighborhoods of entities in relational domains. TETs can be used
as a feature discovery instrument in relational domains, and a metric
on TET features can be constructed, in order to effectively exploit
their expressive power in terms of "counts-of-counts". 

This project contains two parts:

* AIJ_2013: the original TET project, mostly focused on exploring the
  expressiveness of the representation formalism and on learning the
  TET structure from data (please cite [1] as the reference paper).

* DMKD_2018: a follow-up project focusing on the definition of an
  Earth Mover's Distance - based metric on TET values (please cite [2]
  as the reference paper).
